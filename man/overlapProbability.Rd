\title{Overlap Probability Function}
\description{
This function generates a table that contains the probability of generating a specific overlap between groups
when starting with a specific x value.
}
\details{
The function works by examining probability of every x value from 0-100 by 0.9 to generate a matrix with a specific group
overlap. x, in this case, is x[1] supplied to \code{\link{makeMatrix}} and x[2] = x[1] + 100. A matrix is generated \code{reps} times for each x
using the \code{\link{makeMatrix}} function. The overlap between groups is then calculated. When this process completes, a lookup table is
generated. Each x is listed in the lookup table together with the overlap generated in dimension 1 and 2. It was found that
the same overlap is observed in each dimension and that the probability for each overlap is 100 percent (i.e. same overlap observed
in all trials). The lookup table is output as a data frame, primiarly, for use by the \code{\link{overlapMatrices}} function.
Note that the 100 percent overlap for both dims is missing from the table and is currently handled by the \code{\link{dymanicXY}} function.
As well, the lookup table does include the 0 percent overlap but this is overridden by the \code{\link{dynamicXY}} function.
