# ClusterSignificanceTesting

The pupose of this package is to allow all figures associated with the ClusterSignificance package publication to be reproduciable and make all code used to produce them available to the scientific community.

Each figure is associated with one folder in the _inst_ directory. Inside each folder is a .Rmd file which can be easily opened and "_knitted_" in, for example, R-Studio. All raw code used to produce the figure is within the file. As well, each figure is re-created within the file and, finally, for some figures there are additional plots and analysis.

Installing the package allows access to all functions utilized in the .Rmd file.
